Wyckoff Indicator V3 (Refined)

The Wyckoff Indicator V3 (Refined) is a customizable Pine Script-based technical analysis tool for TradingView that helps traders identify key market phases and events based on the Wyckoff Method. This indicator detects important market signals like Buying Climax (BC) and Selling Climax (SC), providing traders with insights into potential market reversals.

Features

Key Features of Wyckoff Indicator V3:

Trend Detection:

Detects uptrends and downtrends using a customizable Exponential Moving Average (EMA) as a trend filter.

Includes multi-timeframe (MTF) trend confirmation to enhance the reliability of the trend signal.


Accumulation/Distribution Phases:

Identifies key Wyckoff phases such as Accumulation and Distribution based on price and volatility analysis.

Accumulation is identified during uptrends, while distribution is detected during downtrends.


Volume Spike Detection:

Automatically detects volume spikes, which are critical in Wyckoff analysis for spotting potential Buying Climax (BC) and Selling Climax (SC) events.


Risk/Reward Targeting:

Automatically calculates risk/reward levels based on recent volatility, making it easier for traders to set stop-loss and target levels.


Bollinger Bands:

Plots Bollinger Bands to show market volatility and help traders spot breakout opportunities or potential reversals.


RSI Divergence Detection:

Detects divergence between price action and the Relative Strength Index (RSI), which can be an early signal of a reversal.


Dynamic Support and Resistance:

Automatically calculates dynamic support and resistance levels based on recent price action and ATR (Average True Range), providing clearer entry and exit levels.



Customization:

The Wyckoff Indicator V3 is fully customizable to suit various trading strategies and preferences. Here are some of the parameters you can adjust:

Swing Length: Adjusts the length of the swing high/low for detecting accumulation and distribution zones.

Volume Multiplier: Modify the multiplier to control the sensitivity of volume spike detection.

ATR Length: Customizes the period used for calculating the Average True Range (ATR) for volatility analysis.

EMA Length: Change the length of the trend confirmation EMA to match your preferred trend-following approach.

Risk/Reward Factor: Set the risk/reward ratio to automatically calculate stop-loss and target price levels.

Multi-Timeframe (MTF) Settings: Choose a higher timeframe for trend confirmation to filter out low-quality signals.

Minimum Event Spacing: Set the minimum number of bars between detected events (BC/SC) to avoid false signals.


These parameters make the script adaptable for different market conditions and trading strategies, allowing users to tailor it to their specific needs.

Example: Adjusting the Volume Spike Sensitivity

If you want to make the volume spike detection more sensitive, you can reduce the volMultiplier parameter. For example:

volMultiplier = input.float(1.2, title="Volume Spike Multiplier") // More sensitive

Example: Adjusting Trend Filter Sensitivity

To make the trend filter more reactive to price changes, you can adjust the emaLength:

emaLength = input.int(30, title="Trend Confirmation EMA Length") // Faster trend filter

Example: Changing the Risk/Reward Ratio

You can customize the risk/reward ratio to adjust the stop-loss and target price levels:

riskRewardFactor = input.float(2.5, title="Risk/Reward Ratio Factor") // Higher ratio
