- Includes trend filters based on Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) to confirm the broader market trend.
- Volume analysis for detecting **Volume Spikes** that are associated with key market events.
- Multi-timeframe (MTF) analysis for confirming trends across different timeframes.
- Visual aids for BC and SC, with labels and plots for easy interpretation.

### How to Use:

1. **Understanding the Phases:**
   - The indicator identifies **Accumulation** and **Distribution** phases based on market conditions, helping traders understand market sentiment.
   - **Accumulation** occurs when the market is consolidating with low volatility, indicating potential buying pressure.
   - **Distribution** occurs when the market is showing signs of high volatility and selling pressure.

2. **Key Signals (BC and SC):**
   - The indicator will display labels and visual markers for **Buying Climax (BC)** and **Selling Climax (SC)** events, which may signal a market reversal.
   - **BC** typically occurs at resistance levels with high volume and is associated with a potential sell-off.
   - **SC** typically occurs at support levels with high volume and is associated with a potential rally.

3. **Trend Confirmation (EMA & MTF):**
   - The indicator uses EMAs to filter trades based on the broader market trend, ensuring signals are in the direction of the prevailing trend.
   - **Multi-timeframe (MTF) analysis** provides additional confirmation from higher timeframes.

### Example Use Case:

1. If the indicator identifies a **Buy Climax (BC)** at a resistance level with a volume spike, this might suggest a potential reversal to the downside.
2. Conversely, if a **Sell Climax (SC)** is detected at a support level with a volume spike, it may indicate a potential reversal to the upside.
